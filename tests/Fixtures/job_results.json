      "description": "Product Description\nWalking your dog should be a stress-free experience, and the PetSafe Adjustable Martingale Collar is designed to make that possible. This innovative collar is an ideal solution for pet parents looking for more control without sacrificing comfort or safety. Unlike traditional choke collars, the PetSafe Martingale Collar uses a limited-slip design that only tightens when needed, preventing accidental escapes and discouraging pulling in a gentle, humane way. This makes it an excellent choice for gentle behavior training and improving leash manners. Made with premium nylon, the PetSafe Martingale Collar is both strong long lasting and lightweight for daily wear. Its martingale loop design provides gradual pressure rather than harsh corrections, which helps stop gagging and prevents injury to your dog’s neck and throat. It’s a comfortable alternative to a choke collar for dogs that need extra security during walks, especially those who tend to slip out of standard collars. The adjustable fit ensures that this collar can be tailored to your dog’s size for maximum safety and a secure fit. With easy to put on off functionality, this collar makes preparing for walks quick and convenient. Since 1988, PetSafe has been driven by a simple belief: safe, healthy pets lead to happier lives for pets and their families.
